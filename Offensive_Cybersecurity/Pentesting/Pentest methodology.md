1. **Information gathering**

	This stage involves collecting as much publicly accessible information about a target/organization as possible, for example, OSINT and research.
	
	**Note:** This does not involve scanning any systems.

2.  **Enumeration / scanning**

	This stage involves discovering applications and services running on the systems. For example, finding a web server that may be potentially vulnerable.
	
3. **Exploitation**

	This stage involves leveraging vulnerabilities discovered on a system or application. This stage can involve the use of public exploits or exploiting application logic.
	
4. **Privilege escalation**

	Once you have successfully exploited a system or application (known as a foothold), this stage is the attempt to expand your access to a system. You can escalate horizontally and vertically
	
5. **Post exploitation**
	This stage involves a few *sub-stages*:  

	1.** What other hosts can be targeted (pivoting)

	2.** What additional information can we gather from the host now that we are a privileged user

	3.**  Covering your tracks

	4.** Reporting
