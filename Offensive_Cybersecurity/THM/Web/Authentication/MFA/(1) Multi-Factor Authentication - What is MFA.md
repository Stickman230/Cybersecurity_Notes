# What is MFA ?

**Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** plays an important role in modern-day applications. Instead of just relying on a password, MFA throws in extra layers of defense. MFA is a combination of different checks:
- *Something you know* (like a password), 
- *Something you have* (like your smartphone), 
- *Something you are* (like a fingerprint).
By using these layers, MFA makes it much tougher for threat actors to access user accounts or applications.

### Types of Authentication Factors

MFA typically combines two or more different kinds of credentials from the categories: something you know, something you have, something you are, somewhere you are, and something you do.
