# What are JWT ?

JWTs are self-contained tokens that can be used to securely transmit session information. It is an [open standard](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519), providing information for any developer or library creator who wants to use JWTs. The JWT structure is shown in the animation below

One of the most common types of **tokens** is *JSON Web Tokens (JWT)*, which are passed through the `Authorization: Bearer` header. However, as we are not using the browser's built-in cookie management features, there are standards but nothing is forcing anyone from sticking to these standards. Tokens like JWTs are a way to *standardise token-based session management*.
