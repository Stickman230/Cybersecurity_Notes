# Sensitive Information Disclosure

- *Cookie-based* session management approach is using the server-side session to store several parameters.
	- In PHP, you can use $SESSION['var']=data to store a value associated with the user's session. 

- *Tokens*, the claims are exposed as the entire JWT is sent client-side.

It can lead to **sensitive information disclosure** :

- *Credential disclosure* with the password hash, or even worse, the clear-text password being sent as a claim.
- *Exposure of internal network information* such as the private IP or hostname of the authentication server.

# Signature validation mistakes

**Not Verifying the Signature**

- The first issue with signature validation is when there is *no signature validation*. 
	- If the server does not verify the signature of the JWT, then it is possible to modify the claims in the JWT to whatever you prefer them to be.
