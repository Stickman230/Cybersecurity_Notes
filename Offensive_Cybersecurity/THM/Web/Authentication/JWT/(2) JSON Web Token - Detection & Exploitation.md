# Sensitive Information Disclosure

- Cookie-based session management approach is using the server-side session to store several parameters. In PHP, for example, you can use $SESSION['var']=data to store a value associated with the user's session. These values are not exposed client-side and can therefore only be recovered server-side. However, with tokens, the claims are exposed as the entire JWT is sent client-side. If the same development practice is followed, sensitive information can be disclosed. Some examples are seen on real applications:

- Credential disclosure with the password hash, or even worse, the clear-text password being sent as a claim.
- Exposure of internal network information such as the private IP or hostname of the authentication server.
