# Sensitive Information Disclosure

- *Cookie-based* session management approach is using the server-side session to store several parameters.
	- In PHP, you can use $SESSION['var']=data to store a value associated with the user's session. 

- *Tokens*, the claims are exposed as the entire JWT is sent client-side.

It can lead to **sensitive information disclosure** :

- *Credential disclosure* with the password hash, or even worse, the clear-text password being sent as a claim.
- *Exposure of internal network information* such as the private IP or hostname of the authentication server.

# Signature validation mistakes

### Not Verifying the Signature

- The first issue with signature validation is when there is *no signature validation*. 
	- If the server does not verify the signature of the JWT, then it is possible to modify the claims in the JWT to whatever you prefer them to be.
==EX:== 

With signature : `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiYWRtaW4iOnRydWUsImlhdCI6MTUxNjIzOTAyMn0.KMUFsIDTnFmyG3nMiGM6H9FNFUROf3wh7SmqJp-QV30`

Without signature : `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiYWRtaW4iOnRydWUsImlhdCI6MTUxNjIzOTAyMn0.`

***Leave only the dot for bypass***

### Downgrading to None

-  JWTs support the `none` signing algorithm, which effectively means that no signature is used with the JWT. 
	- In that case, you can simply change the algorithm specified in your JWT as `none`, which would then cause the library used for signature verification to always return true, thus allowing you again to forge any claims within your token.
==EX:==

With signature algorithm set to **none**:`eyJhbGciOiJub25lIiwidHlwIjoiSldUIn0.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiYWRtaW4iOnRydWUsImlhdCI6MTUxNjIzOTAyMn0.`
