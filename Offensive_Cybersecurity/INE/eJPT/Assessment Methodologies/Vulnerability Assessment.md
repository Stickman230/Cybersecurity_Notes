# History

● **Microsoft Windows is the dominant operating system worldwide** with a market share >=70% as of 2021.
● The popularity and deployment of Windows by individuals and companies makes it a prime target for attackers given the threat surface.
● Over the last 15 years, Windows has had its fair share of severe vulnerabilities, ranging from *MS08-067(Conflicker)* to *MS17-010 (EternalBlue)*.

By default, *Windows is not configured to run securely* and require a proactive implementation of security practices in order to configure Windows to run securely.

#### Types of Windows Vulnerabilities

● **Information disclosure** - Vulnerability that allows an attacker to access confidential data.

● **Buffer overflows** - Caused by a programming error, allows attackers to write data to a buffer and overrun the allocated buffer, consequently writing data to allocated memory addresses.

● **Remote code execution** - Vulnerability that allows an attacker to remotely execute code on the target system.

● **Privilege** escalation - Vulnerability that allows an attacker to elevate their privileges after initial compromise.

● **Denial of Service (DOS)** - Vulnerability that allows an attacker to consume a system/host’s resources (CPU, RAM, Network etc) consequently preventing the system from functioning normally.
