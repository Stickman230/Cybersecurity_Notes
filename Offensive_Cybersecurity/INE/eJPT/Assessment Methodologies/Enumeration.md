# What is Enumeration

After the host discovery and port scanning phase of a penetration test, the next logical phase is going to involve *service enumeration*.

- The goal of service enumeration is to **gather additional, more specific/detailed information about the hosts/systems** on a network and the services running on said hosts.
- This includes information like account names, shares, misconfigured services and so on.
