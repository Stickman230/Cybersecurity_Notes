# What is Security Auditing ?

Security Auditing is a *systematic process of evaluating and verifying the security measures and controls in place within an organization* to ensure they are effective, appropriate, and compliant with relevant standards, policies, and regulations.*

● It involves reviewing various aspects of the organization's information systems, networks, applications, and operational procedures to identify vulnerabilities, weaknesses, and areas for improvement.

# Why do a Security Audit ?

#### Identifying Vulnerabilities and Weaknesses

● Security audits help **uncover vulnerabilities and weaknesses** in an organization's information systems and infrastructure that could be exploited by attackers.
● Regular audits ensure that security controls are **effective and up-to-date,** minimizing the risk of breaches.

#### Ensuring Compliance

● Organizations must comply with **various regulatory requirements and industry standards** to protect sensitive data and maintain trust with customers and stakeholders.
● Security audits help verify compliance with standards such as *GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS, and ISO 27001*, avoiding legal and financial penalties.

#### Enhancing Risk Management

● Audits provide a comprehensive assessment of an organization's security posture, **identifying and prioritizing risks based** on their potential impact.
● Effective risk management strategies can be developed and **implemented based on audit findings** to mitigate identified risks.

#### Improving Security Policies & Procedures

● Security audits review the effectiveness of existing security policies and procedures, **identifying areas for improvement.**
● Updated and robust security policies and procedures help create a strong security culture within the organization.

#### Supporting Business Objectives

● A strong security posture supports overall business objectives by **ensuring that critical business operations are protected from disruptions** caused by security incidents.
● Audits help **build customer trust and confidence**, as clients are assured that their data is handled securely and responsibly.

#### Continuous Improvement

● Security auditing is not a one-time activity but an **ongoing process** that promotes continuous improvement.
● Regular audits ensure that security measures **evolve to address new threats** and vulnerabilities, maintaining a proactive approach to security.

# Security Audit VS Penetration test

Two **separate types of security assessments** that have their *own unique scope, objectives and desired outcomes*

### Sequential approach

● ***Perform Security Audit First:*** Companies often conduct a security audit first to **evaluate their overall security posture, ensure compliance with regulations, and identify areas for improvement** in policies and procedures.

● ***Conduct Penetration Test Afterwards:*** Based on the findings of the audit, a **penetration test may be performed to assess the effectiveness of technical controls and identify specific vulnerabilities**.

*Identifies and addresses gaps in both procedural and technical controls and helps prioritize remediation efforts based on audit findings.*


## Combined approach

Integrate Security Audit and Penetration Testing: Some organizations choose to combine security audits and penetration tests, often through a  holistic security assessment that incorporates both elements.

Advantages
+ Streamlines the assessment process by combining policy, procedural and technical evaluations.
+ Provides a more complete picture of the organization’s security posture
in a single engagement.
+ Can be more efficient and cost-effective by addressing both compliance
and technical vulnerabilities simultaneously.
