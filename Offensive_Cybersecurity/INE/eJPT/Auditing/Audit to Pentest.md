# Phase 2: Security Auditing

*Perform a security audit on a Linux server using Lynis, identify vulnerabilities, and remediate the findings based on the security policy.*

- **Audit the Server:** Run a Lynis audit scan on the target Linux server.
- **Review the Report**: Analyze the Lynis report to identify security issues and recommendations.
- **Address Findings:** Remediate vulnerabilities identified in the Lynis report (e.g., updating software, enforcing password policies).
- **Update Security Policy**: Document remediation actions and update the security policy to reflect changes
