# Phase 1 : Develop a Security Policy

Establish a baseline security policy for Linux servers that aligns with NIST SP 800-53 guidelines, ensuring that servers are configured and managed securely.

# Phase 2: Security Auditing

*Perform a security audit on a Linux server using Lynis, identify vulnerabilities, and remediate the findings based on the security policy.*

- **Audit the Server:** Run a Lynis audit scan on the target Linux server.
- **Review the Report**: Analyze the Lynis report to identify security issues and recommendations.
- **Address Findings:** Remediate vulnerabilities identified in the Lynis report (e.g., updating software, enforcing password policies).
- **Update Security Policy**: Document remediation actions and update the security policy to reflect changes

Use Lynis for automated audit

# Phase 3: Conduct Pentest

*Validate the effectiveness of remediation actions through a penetration test, ensuring that the Linux server is secure and compliant with the security policy.*

- **Compare Results:** Compare initial audit findings with penetration test results to verify that vulnerabilities have been addressed.
- **Check for New Vulnerabilities:** Identify and remediate any new vulnerabilities introduced during the remediation phase.

- **Executive Summary:** Provide an overview of the penetration test and major findings.
- **Methodology:** Detail the tools and techniques used during the test..
- **Recommendations:** Offer steps to further secure the system.
