# Security Auditing Process

![[Audit_lifecycle.png]]

## 1. Planning and Preparation

● **Define Objectives and Scope**: Determine the goals of the audit and the specific systems, processes, and controls to be evaluated.
● **Gather Relevant Documentation**: Collect policies, procedures, network diagrams, and previous audit reports.
● **Establish Audit Team and Schedule**: Assemble the audit team and set a timeline for the audit activities.

## 2. Information Gathering

● **Review Policies and Procedures**: Examine the organization’s security policies, procedures, and standards.
● **Conduct Interviews**: Interview key personnel to understand security practices and identify potential gaps.
● **Collect Technical Information**: Gather data on system configurations, network architecture, and security controls.

## 3. Risk Assessment
● **Identify Assets and Threats**: List critical assets and potential threats to those assets.
● **Evaluate Vulnerabilities**: Assess existing vulnerabilities in systems and processes.
● **Determine Risk Levels**: Assign risk levels based on the likelihood and impact of identified threats and vulnerabilities.

## 4. Audit Execution  
● **Perform Technical Testing:** Conduct technical assessments such as vulnerability scans, penetration tests, and configuration reviews.  
● **Verify Compliance**: Check adherence to relevant regulations and standards.  
● **Evaluate Controls:** Assess the effectiveness of security controls and practices.

## 5. Analysis and Evaluation  
● **Analyze Findings:** Review data collected during the audit to identify security weaknesses and areas for improvement.  
● **Compare Against Standards**: Measure the organization’s security posture against industry standards and best practices.  
● **Prioritize Issues:** Rank findings based on their severity and potential impact on the organization.

## 6. Reporting  
● **Document Findings:** Create a detailed report outlining audit findings, including identified vulnerabilities, non-compliance issues, and ineffective controls.  
● **Provide Recommendations:** Offer actionable recommendations to address identified issues and enhance security.  
● **Present Results:** Share the audit report with relevant stakeholders and discuss key findings and recommendations.

## 7. Remediation  
● **Develop Remediation Plans:** Work with the organization to create plans for addressing the audit findings.  
● **Implement Changes:** Assist in implementing recommended changes and improvements.  
● **Conduct Follow-Up Audits:** Schedule follow-up audits to ensure that remediation efforts have been completed and are effective.  
● **Monitor and Update:** Continuously monitor the organization’s security posture and update security measures as needed.

# Types of Security Audits

| Security Audit            | Audit Objective                                                                                                                                                         | Importance                                                                                                                                                          | Example                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Internal Audits           | Conducted by the organization's internal audit team or security professionals to evaluate the effectiveness of internal controls and compliance with policies.<br><br>  | Internal audits provide insight into the organization’s **self-assessment of its security** posture and highlight areas that may require more in-depth testing.     | An internal audit might review user access controls to ensure that only authorized personnel have access to sensitive data.                                   |
| External Audits           | Performed by independent third-party auditors to provide an unbiased evaluation of the organization’s security measures and compliance with external standards.<br><br> | External audits often serve as **benchmarks for compliance** and security effectiveness. Penetration testers can use these findings to guide their testing efforts. | A company undergoing a PCI DSS compliance audit might hire an external auditor to validate its security controls and ensure they meet the required standards. |
| Compliance Audits         | Focus on verifying that the organization complies with specific regulatory requirements and industry standards (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS).<br><br>                    | Compliance audits help identify regulatory gaps that **penetration testers can** address through targeted testing.                                                  | A healthcare provider might undergo a HIPAA compliance audit to ensure that patient data is protected according to federal regulations.                       |
| Technical Audits <br>     | Focus on assessing the technical aspects of the organization’s IT infrastructure, including hardware, software, and network configurations.<br><br>                     | Technical audits provide a **detailed view of the technical controls** in place, highlighting areas where penetration testing can uncover vulnerabilities.<br>      | A technical audit might involve a thorough review of firewall configurations to ensure they are properly securing the network perimeter.                      |
| Network Audits            | Assess the security of the organization’s network infrastructure, including routers, switches, firewalls, and other network devices.<br><br>                            | Network audits can r**eveal vulnerabilities in network design and configurations** that penetration testers can exploit to assess network security.                 | A network audit might identify insecure protocols being used for data transmission, prompting penetration testers to test for potential exploits.             |
| Application<br>Audits<br> | Evaluate the security of software applications, focusing on code quality, input validation, authentication mechanisms, and data handling.<br><br><br>                   | Application audits highlight security flaws in applications that penetration testers can exploit to demonstrate real-world attack scenarios.<br>                    | An application audit might reveal vulnerabilities such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS) in a web application.                                   |
