# What is Social Engineering

In the context of penetration testing and red teaming, *social engineering is a technique used to manipulate individuals or employees within an organization to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information, systems, or facilities.*

**The weakest link in the security chain: the human element**

The term social engineering was first coined by Dutch industrialist J.C. Van Marken in 1894. Van Marken suggested that specialists were needed to attend to human challenges in addition to technical ones.

● Social Engineering was defined as **a way to encourage people to handle social relations similarly to how they approach machines/mechanical systems**.

Putting people or employees in situations where **they will rely on their base instincts** and most common forms of social interaction:

- The desire to be helpful
- The tendency to trust people
- The desire for approval
- The fear of getting in trouble
- Avoiding conflict or arguments

| **Vishing (Voice<br>Phishing)** | Phishing attacks conducted over phone calls or voice messages, where attackers impersonate legitimate entities (e.g., IT support, bank representatives) to extract sensitive information or manipulate victims into taking specific actions.    |
| **Smishing (SMS Phishing)**     | Phishing attacks conducted via SMS or text messages, where recipients are tricked into clicking on malicious links or providing sensitive information by impersonating trusted entities.                                                        |
| **Pretexting**                  | Creating a false pretext or scenario to gain the trust of targets and extract sensitive information. This may involve impersonating authority figures, colleagues, or service providers to manipulate victims into divulging confidential data. |
| **Baiting**                     | Luring targets into performing a specific action (e.g., clicking on a malicious link, opening a malicious file) by offering enticing incentives or rewards, such as free software, prizes, or job opportunities.                                |
| **Tailgating**                  | Physically following authorized individuals into restricted areas or facilities without proper authentication. Attackers exploit social norms or courtesy to gain unauthorized access to secure locations.                                      |

# Why use Social Engineering

The advent and adoption of Social Networking as a form of communication has vastly *improved the ability and effectiveness of attackers* (likewise pentesters) to perform social engineering attacks as e*mployees/targets can be easily contacted by anyone in the world with ease*.

Furthermore, **Social Networks have also led to the rise of employees advertently/inadvertently exposing a lot of private information**
