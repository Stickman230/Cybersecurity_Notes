# Techniques

## Phishing

1. **Planning & Reconnaissance**: Attackers research the target organization to identify potential targets, gather information about employees, and understand the organization's communication channels and protocols.

2. **Message Crafting:** Attackers create deceptive emails or messages designed to mimic legitimate communications from trusted sources, such as colleagues, IT departments, or financial institutions. These messages often include urgent or compelling language to evoke a sense of urgency or fear.

3. **Delivery**: Attackers send phishing emails or messages to targeted individuals within the organization, using techniques to bypass spam filters and security controls. They may also leverage social engineering tactics to increase the likelihood of recipients opening the messages.

4. **Deception & Manipulation:** The phishing messages contain malicious links, attachments, or requests for sensitive information. Recipients are deceived into clicking on links, downloading attachments, or providing login credentials under false pretenses. 

5. **Exploitation**: Once the victim interacts with the phishing message, attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the target's systems or applications to gain unauthorized access, install malware, or steal sensitive information.

## Spear Fishing

**Target Selection & Research:** Attackers carefully select their targets based on specific criteria, such as job roles, departments, or organizational hierarchies.
● Extensive reconnaissance is conducted to gather information about the targets, including names, job titles, roles, responsibilities, work relationships, and personal interests.
● Publicly available sources, social media profiles, corporate directories, and leaked data may be mined to compile detailed profiles of the targets.


2. **Message Tailoring:** Using the gathered information, attackers craft highly personalized and convincing emails or messages designed to appear legitimate and trustworthy.
● The content of the messages may reference recent events, projects, or activities relevant to the target's role or interests to enhance credibility.
● Attackers may impersonate trusted individuals, such as colleagues, supervisors, or external partners, to increase the likelihood of the targets opening the messages and taking the desired actions.


3. **Delivery:** Spear phishing messages are delivered to the targeted individuals via email, social media, instant messaging platforms, or other communication channels.
● Attackers employ tactics to bypass email security filters and anti-phishing mechanisms, such as using compromised or spoofed email accounts, exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities, or leveraging trusted third-party services.
