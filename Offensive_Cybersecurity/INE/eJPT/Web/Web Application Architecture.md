*Web application architecture refers to the structure and organization of components and technologies used to build a web application.*
# Client-Server Model

In this architecture, the web application is divided into two main components:

- **Client:** The client represents *the user interface and user interaction with the web application*. It is the front-end of the application that users access through their web browsers. The client is *responsible for displaying the web pages, handling user input, and sending requests to the server for data or actions*.

- **Server:** The server represents *the back-end of the web application*. It processes client requests, *executes the application's business logic, communicates with databases and other services, and generates responses to be sent back to the client.*
