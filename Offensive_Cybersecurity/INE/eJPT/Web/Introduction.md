# How does a web application work ?

**● This Client-Server Architecture**
**● User Interface (UI)**
**● Internet Connectivity**
**●Cross-Platform Compatibility**
**●Statelessness:** HTTP, the protocol used for communication between web browsers and servers, is stateless. Web applications must manage user sessions and state to remember user interactions and ensure continuity.

*Users interact with the application by sending  requests to the server, which processes those requests and sends back the appropriate responses.*

The primary objective of web application security is to ensure the ***Confidentiality, integrity, and availability*** of data processed by web applications while mitigating the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and service disruptions.

Web app is a good target because = gain of  personal information, financial data, or intellectual property.

# Web Application Security Practices

● Authentication and Authorization: Implementing robust authentication mechanisms to verify the identity of users and authorization controls to grant appropriate access privileges based on user roles.
● Input Validation: Ensuring that all data inputs from users are validated to prevent common attacks like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
● Secure Communication: Using encryption protocols like HTTPS (TLS/SSL) to secure the communication between the user's browser and the web server, protecting sensitive data in transit.
● Secure Coding Practices: Adhering to secure coding standards and practices to minimize the introduction of vulnerabilities during the development phase.
● Regular Security Updates: Keeping the web application and its underlying software libraries up to date with the latest security patches and updates.
● Least Privilege Principle: Assigning the minimum necessary privileges to users, processes, and systems to reduce the potential impact of a security breach.
● Web Application Firewalls (WAF): Implementing a WAF to filter and monitor HTTP requests, blocking malicious traffic and protecting against known attack patterns.
● Session Management: Implementing secure session handling to prevent session hijacking and ensure the user's identity is maintained securely throughout the session.
