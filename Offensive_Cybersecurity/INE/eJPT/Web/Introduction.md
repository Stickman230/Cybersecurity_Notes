# How does a web application work ?

**● This Client-Server Architecture**
**● User Interface (UI)**
**● Internet Connectivity**
**●Cross-Platform Compatibility**
**●Statelessness:** HTTP, the protocol used for communication between web browsers and servers, is stateless. Web applications must manage user sessions and state to remember user interactions and ensure continuity.

*Users interact with the application by sending  requests to the server, which processes those requests and sends back the appropriate responses.*

The primary objective of web application security is to ensure the ***Confidentiality, integrity, and availability*** of data processed by web applications while mitigating the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and service disruptions.

Web app is a good target because = gain of  personal information, financial data, or intellectual property.

# Web Application Security Practices

● Authentication and Authorization
● Input Validation = prevent common attacks like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
● Secure Communication: Using encryption protocols like HTTPS (TLS/SSL) 
● Secure Coding Practices
● Least Privilege Principle
● Web Application Firewalls (WAF): Implementing a WAF to filter and monitor HTTP requests, blocking malicious traffic and protecting against known attack patterns.
● Session Management

# Web Application Security Testing

*Web application security testing is the process of evaluating and assessing the security aspects of web applications to identify vulnerabilities, weaknesses, and potential security risks.*

- conducting various tests and assessments to ensure that web applications are resistant to security threats and can effectively protect sensitive data and functionalities from unauthorized access or malicious activities.
###

- Vulnerability Scanning: Using automated tools to scan the web application
for known vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS),
insecure configurations, and outdated software versions.
○ Penetration Testing: Simulating real-world attacks to assess the
application's defenses and identify potential security weaknesses. This
involves ethical hacking to gain insights into how an attacker might exploit
vulnerabilities.
○ Code Review and Static Analysis: Manual examination of the application's
source code to identify coding flaws, security misconfigurations, and
potential security risks.
Web Application Security Testing Types
● Authentication and Authorization Testing: Evaluating the effectiveness of
authentication mechanisms and access control features to ensure that
only authorized users have appropriate access levels.
● Input Validation and Output Encoding Testing: Assessing how the
application handles user inputs to prevent common security
vulnerabilities like XSS and SQL injection.
● Session Management Testing: Verifying how the application manages
user sessions and related tokens to prevent session-related attacks.
● API Security Testing: Assessing the security of APIs (Application
Programming Interfaces) used by the web application for data exchange
and integration with other systems.
